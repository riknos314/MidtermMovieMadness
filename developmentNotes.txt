This is where we write what we are working on.

Also naming conventions go here.

	--I used a document.getElementById('movietitle') to refer to our input search box in the HTML doc;
		we don't have the input element in the HTML file yet but when we do we just need to make sure the
		id's match so we don't get an awkward error
		
	--Fixed searching algorithm for converting movie titles to URI form (word+word+word)
	
	--Just fixed the wrong movie problem (search the dark knight and RT returns the dark knight rises)
	
	--Finished main function for Rotten Tomatoes API--I separated getting the info from pushing it onto the
	page so that the code doesn't get too messy. Look at the JS file to see exactly what I mean--I just created
	a few functions that we can define once we know how we want to push things onto the page exactly. I documented the code
	pretty heavily, so you can see what I mean.


TODO: Hitting enter also calls the function; reloading problem

HTML CREATION CONVENTIONS

	for each element, make a <div> tag, then place the content within the appropriate tags inside of said <div>
		This is to allow for more flexibility in CSS styling.
		
		
For our presentation (and really just for fun), a list of our notable technical challenges:
	(For javascript) 1) Searching algorithms, both for RT movies and for the different types of objects
						i)The Dark Knight vs. The Dark Knight Rises
							a)Typos
						ii)Weird JSON objects--searching for titles of movies and movie theatre names
					 2)Same-origin problem
							a)JSONP for Rotten Tomatoes
					 3)Vague documentation for targetURL for Gracenote
					 4) Massive typo error for movie theatre function
					 5) API key problem
