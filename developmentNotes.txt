This is where we write what we are working on.

Also naming conventions go here.

	--I used a document.getElementById('movietitle') to refer to our input search box in the HTML doc;
		we don't have the input element in the HTML file yet but when we do we just need to make sure the
		id's match so we don't get an awkward error
		
	--Fixed searching algorithm for converting movie titles to URI form (word+word+word)
	
	--Still haven't fixed the wrong movie problem (search the dark knight and RT returns the dark knight rises)
